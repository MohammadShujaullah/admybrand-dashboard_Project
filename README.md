## 🧠 Challenges Faced

| #  | Challenge | Solution |
|----|-----------|----------|
| 1. | `darkMode: 'class'` wasn't working | Moved Tailwind config properly and added class-based toggling |
| 2. | `autoTable is not a function` error | Fixed by installing `jspdf-autotable` correctly with `npm install jspdf jspdf-autotable` |
| 3. | Hydration Mismatch Warning | Used `useEffect` + `isClient` check before rendering charts |
| 4. | Dark mode toggle only worked one-way | Fixed toggle state using `ThemeProvider` and `useTheme()` |
| 5. | Recharts didn’t animate | Wrapped cards with `FramerMotion` and `AnimatedMetricCard` |
| 6. | Date filter logic with string-based dates | Handled using native JS `Date` comparisons |
| 7. | UI broken after installing ShadCN | Fixed by reapplying Tailwind config and base styles |
| 8. | CSV and PDF export failed | Properly integrated `papaparse` and `jspdf-autotable` libraries |
